/*  Jest is really FREAKING AWESOME because it comes with everything 
packaged together. This means no more extra libraries for testing. Jest
also allows for both front-end (only React though I believe) and 
back-end testing. Really makes writing unit tests for your particular
feature easy!

Refer below for writing correct tests:

1. Create a new section for your tests using comments 
  (ex: /*Tests for Artist Component & Artist List Component)

2. Import whatever you have to 
  (ex: import ArtistList from '../client/src/Components/ArtistList.jsx')
  
2b. Everything else has already been imported such as React, { mount } 
from enzyme, etc.

3. Write 5 tests that pertain to only YOUR ticket; use the example tests 
for guidance

4. Don't worry about other people's tests that are already in here, just 
keep adding yours to the top

Special Note: According to Jest Docs, you should only have 2-3 tests for your
React components. Bless up!!
